        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A simple yet delicious appetizer or side that makes eating corn on the cob a bit less messy.
            By cuttin the corn in to slices it becomes easier to eat and also increases the amount of char
            and flavor per bite for a mouth watering experience that will change the way you eat corn.</p>
        <p>This <em>vegetarian</em> option is a perfect addition for non-meat eaters at your barbeque. 
            I would highly recommend pairing this with a mayonnaise based spicy dipping sauce to have 
            out on the side or to drizzle on top for even more flavor.</p>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp garlic powder</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp onion powder</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp chili powder</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp Cajun seasoning</li>
            <li>2 ears fresh corn, sliced into 6 equal-sized rings</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
            <li>2 tsp chopped fresh chives, for garnish</li>
            <li>1/4 cup ranch dressing, or to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h4>Directions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Combine butter, chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder, and Cajun seasoning in a microwave-safe dish and cook in the microwave until butter is fully melted, about 1 minute. Remove from microwave and stir.</li>
            <li>Use tongs to dip a corn ring into the spiced butter, making sure to coat it thoroughly in the spices. Transfer to a plate and continue until all of the rings have been dipped. There will be butter remaining.</li>
            <li>Heat an oven-safe skillet over medium heat. Once heated, place corn rings into the skillet, season them individually with sea salt, and let them sizzle away until a nice sear has developed, about 3 minutes. Flip and use a basting brush to brush remaining butter onto the seared sides of the rings. Season again with salt and continue to cook for 2 more minutes.</li>
            <li>Transfer the skillet into the preheated oven and cook for 10 minutes. Carefully flip the rings and cook for 5 more minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and transfer to a serving platter. Sprinkle chives over top and serve with ranch dressing, along with corn skewers for picking up individual rings.</li>
        </ol>
